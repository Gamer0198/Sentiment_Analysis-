# Stock Prediction Using GAN and Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`stock-prediction-gan-twitter-sentiment-analysis.ipynb`) that implements a machine learning model for stock price prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and sentiment analysis of Twitter data.

## Features
- Data collection from Twitter API
- Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques
- Stock price data preprocessing
- Implementation of GANs for stock price prediction
- Performance evaluation and visualization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment and install dependencies using the following:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
The project uses the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- transformers
- tensorflow/keras
- matplotlib
- seaborn

To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk transformers tensorflow keras matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook stock-prediction-gan-twitter-sentiment-analysis.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the sentiment analysis and stock price prediction pipeline.

## Data Sources
- Twitter data (via Twitter API)
- Stock market historical prices

## Results & Findings
- Sentiment analysis models provide insights into stock market trends.
- GAN-based models generate realistic stock price predictions.
- Strong correlation observed between sentiment trends and stock price movements.
